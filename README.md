# Richter-s-Predictor-Modeling-Earthquake-Damage
We're trying to predict the ordinal variable damage_grade, which represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. There are 3 grades of the damage:  
1 represents low damage  

2 represents a medium amount of damage 

3 represents almost complete destruction

building a pipeline then Using ML tools like XGBoost NN to predict the damage_grade
